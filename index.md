## Welcome!

Having recently made some massive changes to my resume ahead of the upcoming search for a new job, I discovered how out-dated my 2016 landing page had become.

So here we are, fresh jekyll site, updated gems, and a fresh CV for any potential employers that I refer to this page.

### LaMiâœˆJet Demo

I built an end-to-end inventory management system on a MEAN stack (i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js)
to provide employees with mobile-web or offline-sync access to product search, stock and reorder functionality.

This [project](https://github.com/chadrm9/lami-jet) was extended from an [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) v3.5.0 scaffolding to suit design requirements.

Contact [me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) for credentials and login to the demo [here](https://lamijet.herokuapp.com).
